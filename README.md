Hebrew theory test exam for rank B license. Built with dioxus. <br>
It is hosted on github pages: https://usering-around.github.io/theory_test_exam/

To build locally: Install rust, clone the repo, and then run: <br>
`cargo install dx-cli`  (ensure that the .cargo folder is in PATH) <br>
`cd theory_test_ui` <br>
`dx serve` <br>

Todo: <br>
Make the interface prettier <br>
Add time <br>
Add more license types (should be fairly easy)

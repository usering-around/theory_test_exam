Hebrew theory test exam for rank B license. Built with dioxus.

Build: Install rust, clone the repo, and then run: <br>
`cargo install dx-cli`  (ensure that the .cargo folder is in PATH) <br>
`cd theory_test_ui` <br>
`dx serve` <br>

Todo: 
Make the interface prettier
Add time
Add more license types (should be fairly easy)
